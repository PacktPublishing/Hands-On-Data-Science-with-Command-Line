This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Science with the Command Line](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-data-science-command-line?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789132984), published by Packt.

**Automate everyday data science tasks using command-line tools**

## What is this book about?
The Command Line has been in existence on UNIX-based OSes in the form of Bash shell for over 3 decades. However, very little is known to developers as to how command-line tools can be OSEMN (pronounced as awesome and standing for Obtaining, Scrubbing, Exploring, Modeling, and iNterpreting data) for carrying out simple-to-advanced data science tasks at speed.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn how to manage users, groups, and permissions
* Encrypt and decrypt disks with Linux Unified Key Setup /Luks
* Setup SSH for remote access, and connect it to other nodes
* Understand how to add, remove, and search for packages
* Use NFS and Samba to share directories with other users
